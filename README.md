<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Microsoft Engage 2021

This project is a part of Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2021. It was a 4 week program organized by Microsoft India Team. The task was to build a Microsoft Teams Clone with at least one mandatory functionality, that is, a minimum of two participants should be able connect with each other to have a video conversation.
Throughout this project, my fellow mentees and I had constant support from the mentors(Ms. Salona Sinha and Mr. Nikhil Arora). Also, various AMA Sessions, Webinars and Leader talks were organized by Microsoft and Team Ace Hacker during this period.

### Agile Methodology
This project is built using Agile Methodology.
Agile scrum methodology is a project management system that relies on incremental development. Usually, each iteration consists of 2-4 week sprints, where each sprint's goal is to build the most important features first and come out with a potentially deliverable product. More features are built into the product in subsequent sprints and are adjusted based on stakeholder and customer feedback between sprints.
Microsoft divided the project into 3 sprints: <em> Design, Build & Adapt </em>. Since this was a small project, so after the design phase I further divided the project into 2-3 days sprints. They are:
<ul> 
  <li>[Initialization] Setting up the server (locally)</li>
  <li>[Minimum Functionality] Enabling the connection (videos/audios) between two tabs on the same device</li>
  <li>Adding the in-call chat feature</li>
  <li>Adding <em>User Authentication</em> and basic <em>Authorization</em></li>
  <li>Adding <em>Join Meeting</em> feature and <em>Create Meeting</em> feature</li>
  <li>Adding basic Error Handling</li>
  <li>Deploying the App</li>
  <li>Giving basic User Interface</li>
  <li>Adding <em>Private Meeting</em> feature </li>
  <li>Adding <em>Add Participants Feature</em>
  <li>[Adapt Stage] Integrating the <em>before and after meeting chat</em> option with already built chat feature</li>
  <li>Adding/improving styling in the app</li>
</ul>
